# BIONLP_PROJ1



# TODO 
In the add_note section we neeed to do the following 
1. Add a list that stores the original text match. (used for symptom expression) 
2. Convert the match onto the standard symptom variable. This will need a dict that matches CUIS to symptoms 
3. Once 1 and 2 are done we need to  update the pandas series. Returning a filled out dataframe. If modification in place does not work. We return a list of series and concatenate them. (ensure insertion order) 

TESTING 
1. verify correct nature of negation  flags
