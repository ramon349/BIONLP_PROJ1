# TODO 
1. Verify the detection of symptoms and use of negations is correct 
2. subtle fix.  The terms need to start $$$ 


There are soe cases were there is a penalty for disagreement where they might not be in fuzzy cluster settigns. 

The term congestion can be ambiguous in what region of the body. 
There are seperate codes for nasal and chest congestion. Gold standard 
has nasal congestion while mine has  congestion as chest congestion due to lexicon containing congestion being a part of chest congestion symptom. 

Would need to remedy lexicon so that congestion maps to nasal/head instead of head. ( This would be an interesitng angle to pursue when discusisong  short commings of the system) 
i.e coloquial use by individuals is not the same as the formal uses. Leaving to much more fuzzier class memberships
